# Aren Abad (He/Him)

Born in Florida and raised in Houston TX

Started taking computer science classes in 9th grade and will continue to pursue through College

I am a 12th grade student who's about to graduate

I animate 3d animations, usually through SFM but I have dabbled in major applications such as Blender and Maya(3/10 never use this for modelling)

I have a dog named Theo who if I had the choice I would trade the rest of my life for

Fun fact: I have an unhealthy obsession with Transformers and if you see me 6 times out of 10 I'm carrying a Transformers figure with me
